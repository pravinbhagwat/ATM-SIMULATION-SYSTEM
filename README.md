## Problem Statement:
â€¢ The Bank Management system consists of the bank administrator and the customer. The administrator will need to create a new account for the customer by logging into their existing account. 
The system executes operations like creating a new account, checking the balance of the account, withdrawing, depositing, money transfers between two accounts, and viewing transaction history.

Devised a effective banking platform with Java at front-end and MySQL at the back-end as a provision. 
Incorporated several key observations as salient features to improve performance such as perceived visual ease, customer feedback acceptance and data security.

## Technology Stack and Tools used:
1. Java (OOPs concepts)
2. NetBeans-IDE
3. MySQL (for database operations.)
